## Introduction :

The Code of the Game of Life (1970: John Conway Always and Again) was proposed in the magazine "L'ordinateur de poche" in April 1981

I always have the magazine at home on this complete Turing cellular automaton

## Remark :

- The actual mechanisms of evolution are, however, far far richer than most genetic algorithms allow

- For the example of our cellular automaton , mutations can involve reversals, duplications, and movement of large chunks of DNA

- Biology is in the situation of physics before the quantum revolution. A new theory of evolution is missing.

- Let's hope that this new theory will be available in the 21st century : some new theories here :

- Denton, D'Arcy Thompson: There are Platonic forms or archetypes in nature and mathematical laws influencing the forms of living beings.

- Conway-Morris, de Duve: the evolution of life would in one way or another be channeled towards increasingly complex forms leading to the existence of conscious beings.
Sch√ºtzenberger: Evolution follows an optimal control algorithm.
